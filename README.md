### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m an Automation student who want to bride his knowledge on STEM concepts, specialty math, robotics, programming, machine learning. I havenâ€™t yet worked on a real-life tough engineering problem, but I would like to try and see if I could perform good in it too. 

Iâ€™m currently working on documentation to my hexapod robot and learning machine learning to my upcoming project on European Astro pi project, I have hope that me and my team can win the whole contest this time. 

I like math and creating my own ways of solving complex mathematical problems, even though I didnâ€™t learn much mathematics in school, at this year Norwegian math contest I was in best 20% of best results, even though the last time I had math in school was one and a half year ago and I had just some basic math then. I could compete with students that are taking 3 level higher math then I ever was.

In addition to all of that I work on a Minecraft server with a couple of friends, I have the role of developer, so I am making plugins for that server for players to have a good time on, this isnâ€™t something that we think we could ever profit from, but it is fun to create that and have a server with a good community. Some of plugins I create for that server I post here.
