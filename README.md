### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an Automation student who wants to bride his knowledge on all of the STEM concepts, specialty math, robotics, programming, machine learning. I havenâ€™t yet worked on a real-life tough engineering problem, but I would like to try and see if I could perform well in it too. 
Iâ€™m currently working on documentation for my hexapod robot and learning machine learning for my upcoming project on the European Astro pi project, I hope that I and my team win the whole contest this time. 

I like math and creating my own ways of solving complex mathematical problems, even though I didnâ€™t learn much mathematics in school, at this year's Norwegian math contest I was in best 20% of the best results, even though the last time I had math in school was one and a half year ago and I had just some basic math then. I could compete with students that are taking 3 levels higher in math than I ever was.

In addition to all of that I work on a Minecraft server with a couple of friends, I have the role of developer, so I am making plugins for that server for players to have a good time on, this isnâ€™t something that we think we could ever profit from, but it is fun to create that and have a server with a good community. Some of the plugins I create for that server I post also here.
